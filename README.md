# Breast Cancer Prediction from Mammograms

This project combines mammogram image analysis and lifestyle-related risk factors to predict the likelihood of breast cancer. It uses a multimodal neural network that considers both visual and clinical data to provide a more personalized prediction.

A Tkinter-based interface allows users to:
- Upload their own DICOM-format mammograms
- Enter lifestyle and family history information
- View prediction results
- Download a personalized PDF risk report with feature importance

## How it Works

1. **Mammogram Image Input**  
   DICOM images are preprocessed and passed through a CNN to extract visual patterns.

2. **Lifestyle & Risk Factor Input**  
   The user provides additional data such as:
   - Age
   - Smoking/alcohol history
   - Marital status
   - Family history of breast cancer
   - Menopause status
   - BMI range

3. **Multimodal Prediction**  
   The model merges both image and clinical inputs to predict whether the case is likely benign or malignant.

4. **SHAP Explainability**  
   SHAP values are used to show which lifestyle features most influenced the prediction.

5. **PDF Report**  
   A downloadable report is generated with:
   - Patient details
   - Prediction result
   - Risk factor analysis
   - Estimated future risk across different ages
